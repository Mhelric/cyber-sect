*Cyber Concept:* Represents "Hardening" infrastructure—making the baseline system tougher to crack.

**Class Strategy:** "The Controller (Red Team)." This is an Advanced Class. While the Blue Team (Defenders) waits for attacks, the Pen Tester (Red Team) thinks like a hacker to beat them. They use High Cost / High Impact cards to disrupt enemy logic, steal resources, and break through invulnerable shields.

**Signature Match Focus:** Extremely effective against 🎭 Social Class (Phishing) and 🔒 Crypto Class (Ransomware).

## 🔄 Operator Switching

**Protocol:**
You may switch your Active Class **between levels** (on the Map Screen).
