# 👾 Threat Classifications (Enemy Profiles)

## 🎨 Visual Identification Guide (Color Coding)
To assist Operators in rapid threat identification, all enemies follow this color schema:

## 🦠 Malware (The Code Breakers)

**Threat Level:** Standard / Common

**Primary Appearance:** Chapters 1 & 3 (Infiltration & Propagation)

**Properties:**
Focus: Direct Damage | Health: Medium | Speed: Average

**Role:**
The brute force attackers. They corrupt files and replicate to overwhelm system integrity.

**Combat Behavior: Corruption**
Attacks apply "Fragile" or "Poison" (Memory Leak), dealing consistent damage over time.

**Strategic Weakness: Signature Match**
Takes **Double Damage** from cards tagged with **[Antivirus]**.
*Cyber Concept:* Traditional viruses have known code signatures that antivirus software can easily identify and purge.

## 🌐 Network (The Traffic Jammers)

**Threat Level:** Standard / Swarm
**Primary Appearance:** Chapters 1 & 3 (Perimeter & DDoS)

**Properties:**
Focus: Swarms & Clutter | Health: Low | Speed: Fast

**Role:**
The distractions. They rely on volume—spamming your deck with junk cards (Adware) or attacking in groups (Botnets).

**Combat Behavior: Flooding**
They rarely hit hard individually but attack multiple times per turn or clog your hand with unplayable cards.

**Strategic Weakness: Filtering**
Takes **Reflected Damage** or gets **Stunned** by cards tagged with **[Firewall]**.
*Cyber Concept:* High-volume traffic (DDoS) cannot be "killed" one by one; it must be filtered and blocked at the perimeter.

## 🎭 Social (The Deceivers)

**Threat Level:** High Complexity
**Primary Appearance:** Chapter 2 (The Human Factor)

**Properties:**
Focus: Traps & Stealing | Health: Medium | Speed: Hidden

**Role:**
The tricksters. They hide their intentions or punish the player for acting blindly.

**Combat Behavior: Baiting**
They often enter a "Passive" state where attacking them triggers a counter-attack (Trap). They may also steal your Energy (RAM).

**Strategic Weakness: Analysis**
Traps are **Disarmed** or effects are **Nullified** by cards tagged with **[Scan / Utility]**.
*Cyber Concept:* Phishing and social engineering rely on ignorance. Once you "verify" (scan) the source, the threat effectively disappears.

## 🔒 Crypto (The Lockers)

**Threat Level:** Elite / Boss
**Primary Appearance:** Chapters 4 & 5 (Advanced Threats)

**Properties:**
Focus: Invulnerability & Lockout | Health: High | Speed: Slow

**Role:**
The heavy hitters. They lock your cards (Encryption) or have massive shields that regenerate.

**Combat Behavior: Ransom**
They can "Lock" specific cards in your hand, making them unplayable until the enemy is damaged or a specific cost is paid.

**Strategic Weakness: Decryption**
Defense is **Bypassed** (Shield Pierce) by cards tagged with **[Decryption]**.
*Cyber Concept:* Ransomware uses encryption to deny access. Specialized decryption keys are the only clean way to recover without paying the price.

## ⚠️ Threat Protocol Summary

**Combat Doctrine:**
Players must build their deck based on the **Map Intel**.

**Tactical Example:**

* **Sector A (Malware Swarm):** Player switches to **Threat Hunter** and loads **Antivirus** cards.
* **Sector B (Phishing Zone):** Player switches to **Pen Tester** and loads **Scan** cards to avoid traps.
