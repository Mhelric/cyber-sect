# Educational Framework & Industry Alignment

**CyberSect** is designed not just as a game, but as an interactive simulation of real-world cybersecurity defense. The narrative and gameplay progression map directly to the **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain®**, ensuring players internalize industry-standard processes while playing.

## Mapping Gameplay to the Kill Chain

The campaign chapters mirror the lifecycle of a cyber attack, moving from initial breach to high-stakes impact.

| Game Chapter | Real-World Phase | Educational Takeaway |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prologue & Ch 1**<br>*(Infiltration)* | **Delivery & Exploitation** | Demonstrates that attacks originate at the **Perimeter**. Players learn that "Infiltration" is a specific entry event (exploit), not magic. |
| **Chapter 2**<br>*(The Human Factor)* | **Installation**<br>*(via Phishing)* | Highlights **Social Engineering**. Teaches that the human user is often the weakest link, dispelling the myth that hacking is purely code-based. |
| **Chapter 3**<br>*(Network Chaos)* | **Command & Control (C2)** | Simulates **Lateral Movement**. The "chaos" represents the attacker establishing control and moving sideways through the network to locate high-value assets. |
| **Chapter 4**<br>*(Advanced Threats)* | **Actions on Objectives** | Introduces **Persistence**. The "Fusion/APT" mechanics teach that advanced threats bury themselves deep in the Kernel to resist removal. |
| **Chapter 5**<br>*(Final Assault)* | **Impact**<br>*(Data Destruction)* | Focuses on **Availability & Integrity**. The final boss represents modern **Ransomware**, teaching that the ultimate threat is often data lockout, not just theft. |

## Pedagogical Scaffolding

The game utilizes a "Concept-First" approach to introduce complex technical topics gradually:

1.  **Basics (Malware):** Starts with simple viruses (Concept: *Direct Damage*).
2.  **Human Element (Phishing):** Introduces deception and verification (Concept: *Authentication*).
3.  **Scale (DDoS/Worms):** Introduces network traffic volume (Concept: *Availability*).
4.  **Abstraction (Encryption/Polymorphism):** Ends with complex, mutating code logic (Concept: *Obfuscation*).

## ⚖️ Design Philosophy: Myth vs. Reality

To ensure **CyberSect** promotes ethical and accurate security practices, we actively address common media tropes through game mechanics:

### 1\. The "Solo Hero" Myth

  * **The Trope:** One hacker saves the world alone.
  * **The Reality:** Cybersecurity is a team sport played by a **SOC (Security Operations Center)**.
  * **Our Solution:** While the player has a single avatar, the deck includes "Support Cards" (e.g., *Threat Intel Feed*, *SOC Analysis*), implying reliance on a wider team infrastructure.

### 2\. The "Active Defense" Myth

  * **The Trope:** "Hacking back" or destroying the attacker's computer.
  * **The Reality:** Offensive countermeasures against attackers are generally illegal.
  * **Our Solution:** Player actions are framed as **Remediation**. Terminology focuses on *"Purging," "Isolating,"* and *"Sanitizing"* the local network, rather than "destroying" the external enemy.
