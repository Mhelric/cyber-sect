# Game Storyboard: [CyberSect]

## **PROLOGUE: The Breach**
* **The Incident:** Inside the server room, chaos ensues. The **CEO** demands a plain-English explanation for the failure.
* **The Diagnosis:** The **CIO** explains they haven't just been hacked; they have suffered a **Total System Compromise**. The attacker has **Root Access**, meaning traditional remote fixes are impossible.
* **The Solution:** The CIO recruits a specialist—the **Agent White**.
* **The Entry:** The Operator/White Hat uses an experimental **EEG Neural Link** (a metaphor for Deep Packet Inspection) to physically project his consciousness into the code.
* **Transition:** A bolt of lightning strikes the interface. The Operator/White Hat materializes in the **Corrupted Server World**.
* **Closing Line:** *"I’m in."*

## **CHAPTER 1: Infiltration Begins**
* **Location:** The Network Perimeter.
* **The Mission:** The Operator/White Hat lands in the outer layer of the system. He detects the first signs of entry—standard **Malware** and **Trojan Droppers**.
* **The Action:** He fights off the initial wave of "script kiddie" scripts to secure a foothold.
* **Key Event:** Upon clearing the wave, a system log pops up. The **Black Hat Hacker** is watching and taunts him: *"Nice try, Diddy."*

## **CHAPTER 2: The Human Factor**
* **Location:** The Employee Database / User Accounts.
* **The Mission:** Tracing the breach source, The Operator/White Hat realizes the firewall wasn't broken—it was bypassed. He locates a compromised user account (e.g., "Bob from HR").
* **The Action:** The gameplay shifts to identifying **Deception** enemies. The Operator/White Hat fights off **Phishing Emails** and **Fake Credentials** that masquerade as system files.
* **Key Event:** He "Patches" the human error by securing the compromised account, locking the Black Hat out of the identity management system.

## **CHAPTER 3: Network Chaos**
* **Location:** The Data Highway / Transport Layer.
* **The Mission:** Retaliating against the lockout, the Black Hat unleashes a **DDoS Attack (Distributed Denial of Service)**.
* **The Action:** The screen floods with **Worms** and junk data. The Operator/White Hat must filter through this "Swarm" to locate the path to the **Kernel** (the OS Core).
* **Key Event:** He survives the flood, isolates the noise, and locates the hidden **Backdoor Protocol** deep in the system.

## **CHAPTER 4: Advanced Threats**
* **Location:** The Kernel / Deep System.
* **The Mission:** The Operator/White Hat attempts to deploy a **Containment Drive (Sandboxing)** to trap the Backdoor Protocol.
* **The Action:** The Backdoor reveals itself as **Polymorphic Code**—it mutates and replicates rapidly to escape the sandbox.
* **Key Event:** A surge of corrupted data coalesces. The Black Hat Hacker **fuses** with his own malware, transforming into a living **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** entity.

## **CHAPTER 5: Final Assault**
* **Location:** The Mainframe Core.
* **The Mission:** The Black Hat entity initiates a **Ransomware Lock**, threatening to encrypt and wipe all organizational data permanently.
* **The Action:** The Operator/White Hat fights on a collapsing digital battlefield. He must survive the "Encryption" attacks long enough to execute a **Complete System Override**.
* **The Climax:** The Override is successful. The Black Hat is purged from memory. The system stabilizes.
* **Epilogue:** In the real world, The Operator/White Hat wakes up in the chair. The monitors turn green. The breach is closed.
